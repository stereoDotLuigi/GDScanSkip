Hello! This is the README file.
If you didn't understand what you must do in the app, continue to read.

For example, your Google Drive link is this and you want to download this file instantly:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAXNVj8ZUY3hDHTLovoZMfLX1nbHVc8E/view
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate a direct download link for this file, copy this link's random generated part:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://drive.google.com/file/d/ (1lAXNVj8ZUY3hDHTLovoZMfLX1nbHVc8E) /view
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
( ) = The part you must copy. This is your File ID.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you copied your random generated part (File ID), paste that part to the app and press ENTER.
It will generate a link and the link will be copied automatically.

This program is an average rookie Python script.
Releases will be only .EXE files.
